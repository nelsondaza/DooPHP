## DooPHP's belief

DooPHP believes in doing things as simple as possible. It is a framework for KISS lovers.

	    Confucius(孔子) once said,
	        "Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated."

	    Leonardo da Vinci once said,
	        "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."

	    Albert Einstein once said,
	        "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."

_**So why do things the hard way?**_
